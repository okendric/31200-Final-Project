Less was used for the coloring of the website. The text colors, the background colors, navigation bar color and more.
Responsiveness was achieved by developing the website for mobile first and then expanding it upon there for larger screen sizes. At first some elements weren't responsive but with trial and error, they were all fixed.
The hambuger menu was created for mobile screen sizes. The navigation bar contains 2 different links, the home screen where users can find the list of all 46 presidents at the moment, and a quiz screen where users can take a 10 question interactive quiz about the Presidents.
The favicon included was best designed to reflect the United States of America. This is a symbol that United States presidents surround themselves by.
Bootstrap was used for responsiveness at different screen sizes, buttons, colors, and a modal. All of these elements help to provide additional useful features to the website.
Accessibility is granted in multiple formats through this website. Each president picture contains an alt text that screen readers will utilize. There are aria labels throughout the website as well and semantic tags.
